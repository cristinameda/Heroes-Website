            <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroes_(American_TV_series)">Heroes</a></i> began development in
            2006 when Tim Kring, the creator of NBC's <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossing_Jordan">Crossing Jordan</a></i>, conceived the idea of a large ensemble saga that would resonate with the audience. Feeling that traditional cop or medical dramas
            lacked characters big enough to save the world, Kring envisioned ordinary people discovering extraordinary
            abilities in a character-driven series rooted in reality. Casting directors Jason La Padura and Natalie Hart
            assembled a cast of new faces, including Milo Ventimiglia, who described the TV pilot as a <i>character drama about everyday people with a heightened reality</i>. Production designer Ruth Ammon played a crucial role in bringing this heightened reality to life.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Kring consulted with Damon Lindelof, the executive producer of <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_(2004_TV_series)">Lost</a></i> for advice on pitching the series to the network and navigating serialized drama. NBC's enthusiastic response led to the greenlight of the project. Kring, drawing on his six-year partnership with NBC as the showrunner for <i>Crossing Jordan</i>, pitched the pilot with intricate details, including a cliffhanger ending. The unaired pilot was initially reported to remain unreleased but was later included in the season one DVD set after a special screening at the 2006 San Diego Comic-Con International.

        <h2 id="writing">Writing</h2>
        <p>
            The writing process for <i>Heroes</i> involved assigning individual writers to develop scenes for specific
            characters, which were then combined to form complete episodes. This collaborative approach allowed all
            writers to contribute to each episode, facilitating quicker script completion and providing the filming crew
            with more flexibility in shooting at various locations. Tim Kring emphasized the importance of
            collaboration, especially in serialized dramas where understanding each character's development trajectory
            is crucial for planning multiple scenes at a single location.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Season two of <i>Heroes</i> faced challenges due to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2007%E2%80%9308_Writers_Guild_of_America_strike">Guild of America (WGA) strike</a>, resulting in only 11 out of the planned 24 episodes being produced. This led to a
            restructuring of the season, incorporating only the Generations volume out of the originally planned three
            volumes. The subsequent volumes were reorganized, with <i>Villains</i> becoming the third volume in season
            three. Facing criticism for the complexity of the plot and numerous characters in the second and third
            volumes, the series aimed to return to its roots with the fourth volume, <i>Fugitives</i>. Creative
            differences and budget concerns led to the removal of producers Jesse Alexander and Jeph Loeb, prompting a
            refocusing on character development and simpler storytelling. The series also experienced changes in its
            writing staff, with Bryan Fuller joining and later leaving, while Greg Beeman was fired as director/producer
            by NBC in April 2009.

            <i><strong>Heroes: Original Soundtrack</i></strong> is the official <i>Heroes</i> soundtrack. It was
            released on March 18, 2008, by The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBCUniversal">NBC Universal
                Television, DVD, Music & Consumer Products Group</a>. It contains recordings from the series' score by
            Wendy Melvoin and Lisa Coleman, including the show's theme music. The record also includes contributions
            from Panic! at the Disco, Wilco, Imogen Heap, Bob Dylan, Nada Surf, and David Bowie, among other artists and
            bands. One of the contributions is <i>All Things Must Pass</i>, the first new song in 10 years from The
            Jesus and Mary Chain. They released a re-recorded version of the song, titled <i>All Things Pass</i>, on
            their 2017 album <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damage_and_Joy">Damage and Joy</a></i>.

            On February 29, 2008, NBC Universal Television, DVD, Music & Consumer Products Group released five music
            videos created by Heroes producer/director Allan Arkush, each combining show footage with songs from the
            soundtrack. The music videos were released on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zune">Zune</a> and <a

            Eric Grenaudier and John Han of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargate_Studios">Stargate
                Digital</a> are the visual effects supervisors, and Mark Spatny is the visual effects producer for
            <i>Heroes</i>. They work with visual effects animators Anthony Ocampo and Ryan Wieber, who are also from
            Stargate. The series' visual effects consist of blue screens and 2D and 3D animation. The visual effects for
            the series are created after the scene is shot in post-production, unlike special effects, which are
            incorporated into the scenes during filming. Notable visual effects include radioactive Ted in <i>Company
                Man</i>, Nathan flying from Mr. Bennet and The Haitian in <i>Hiros</i>, and Hiro's time-freezing
            encounter with the schoolgirl in the red bow in <i>One Giant Leap.</i> The special effects were coordinated
            by Gary D'Amico. Stunts were coordinated by Ian Ouinn, who also used blue screens to accomplish some of the
            stunts in the series, such as Nathan Petrelli flying away from Heidi during the car accident scene in <i>Six
                Months Ago</i>. Principal filming for Heroes occurred in Los Angeles and Santa Clarita, California. The
            Stargate Digital team was responsible for making Los Angeles look like international locations, such as
            India and Ukraine, using blue screens and set designs by Ruth Ammon, production designer for the series. The
            series was recorded using a single-camera setup.

            In keeping with the comic book thematic elements used on Heroes, professional comic book artists Tim Sale
            and Alex Maleev were brought in to provide the artwork used within the series under the direction of Ruth
            Ammon, including the artwork of Isaac Mendez, and Mendez's metafictional comic book series, <i>9th
                Wonders!</i>. Additionally, the font used in captions and credits for the show is reminiscent of
            traditional hand-rendered comic book lettering. It was created by Sale and is based on his handwriting
            style. Heroes was designed by production designer Ruth Ammon. Ammon was nominated for her work on
            <i>Heroes</i> twice by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Art_Directors_Guild">Art Directors
                Guild</a> and nominated for two Emmy Awards for excellence in art direction.
