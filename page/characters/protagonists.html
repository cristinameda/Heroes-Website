			<h2>Peter Petrelli</h2>
			<p>
				Peter Petrelli, portrayed by Milo Ventimiglia, is the main protagonist on the NBC science fiction drama series <i>Heroes</i>. 
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				He is a hospice nurse-turned-paramedic in his mid-20s with the power to absorb and mimic the powers of other evolved humans or <i>Evos</i>. Sensitive and compassionate, the character was initially defined by his complex relationship with his older brother, Nathan. Since that time, Peter Petrelli has had to deal with the outcomes from the decisions that his abilities force him to make. In the start of the series, Peter absorbs the ability of a man who is practically a ticking time bomb. In desperation all the characters in the series race to try and save New York City in fear that Peter will "blow up" the city like a bomb. Minutes from when he's about to explode Peter's older brother Nathan flies him high above the skyline and saves the people of New York City.

			<h2>Nathan Petrelli</h2>
			<p>
				Nathan Petrelli, played by Adrian Pasdar, was a major character of the series and was a superhuman with the power of Flight. Nathan was a very serious person. He largely focused on his political campaign. He was married to Heidi Petrelli and had two sons with her, Simon and Monty. It was later revealed that he had a daughter, Claire Bennet, with Meredith Gordon. Nathan's ability allowed him to fly, though he was loath to speak of it and denied it even after his brother, Peter, witnessed him in action. For the first few volumes, he served as a protagonist/anti-hero, but later becomes a supporting antagonist at the end of Volume Three. Nathan becomes an antagonist of the first half of Volume Four but reforms in the latter half of the volume and tries to fix his mistakes by overthrowing his former government operation, of which Emile Danko has seized control.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Nathan was killed by Sylar in the episode <i>An Invisible Thread</i>. At Angela and Noah's urging to keep Nathan "alive" for the sake of their family (themselves, Peter, and Claire, but the latter two are kept unaware of Nathan's death at this time) and to shut down the government operation now controlled by Danko, Matt transformed Sylar into Nathan in order to tell the President this operation was a mistake. After shape-shifting Sylar into Nathan's form, Matt transformed Sylar into Nathan by filling him with Nathan's persona and memories. However, in volume five, once Nathan becomes aware of what happened and realizes he is stuck in Sylar's body, Nathan accepts his death in episode, <i>The Fifth Stage</i>.

			<h2>Hiro Nakamura</h2>
			<p>
				Hiro Nakamura, portrayed by Japanese actor Masi Oka, is a fictional superhero on the NBC series Heroes, equipped with the unique ability of space-time manipulation. This extraordinary power grants Hiro the capability to alter the flow of time, teleport, and engage in time travel. His character is named after Hiroshima, with the intention of ensuring that his family always remembers the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki">atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki</a>. Tim Kring, the creator of Heroes, emphasized the significance of Hiro's name, stating that it's not a coincidence, and Hiro is genuinely on a hero's quest. This naming choice is often humorously exploited, as his co-worker and best friend Ando playfully referred to him as <i>Super-Hiro</i>.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Hiro Nakamura was a late addition to the main characters, created by Tim Kring for the pilot episode after recognizing that none of the existing characters were content with their powers. Kring developed Hiro as a comic book enthusiast <i>trapped in a life that was kind of not of his making</i>. Initially introduced as an office worker amidst a sea of cubicles, Hiro's character represents someone yearning for a more fulfilling life. Tim Kring explained that the choice of Hiro's power, teleportation, was a result of wanting a power that would be wish-fulfilling for a character feeling trapped in an undesirable reality.

			<h2>Mohinder Suresh</h2>
			<p>
				Mohinder Suresh is a fictional character on the NBC drama <i>Heroes</i>, portrayed by Sendhil Ramamurthy. He is from Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India and is a genetics professor at the University of Madras. Mohinder is attempting to find the truth behind the sudden death of his father, Chandra Suresh, portrayed by Erick Avari, and to continue his father's research of finding 'superhuman' beings on Earth. In character, Suresh also provides many episodes with opening and/or closing dialogue, generally philosophical musings regarding the events that take place during the episode.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				The role of Mohinder was originally written to be a 55-year-old geneticist looking for super-powered humans. However, Sendhil Ramamurthy's audition was so convincing that the main character part was rewritten to be a younger geneticist following in his father's footsteps. The concept of the older geneticist was spun off into the minor, yet central, character of Chandra Suresh.

			<h2>Claire Bennet</h2>
			<p>
				Claire Bennet, portrayed by Hayden Panettiere, is a pivotal fictional character in the NBC psychological thriller superhero drama series Heroes. Making her debut in the pilot episode "Genesis" on September 25, 2006, Claire is a high school cheerleader endowed with the extraordinary power of rapid cellular regeneration. This unique ability grants her an incredibly high pain tolerance, allowing her to recover swiftly from injuries. Despite feeling pain as intensely as any injured person initially, her power rapidly dulls the sensation. With an impressive appearance in 72 episodes, plus a 73rd through stock footage, Claire becomes one of the most prominently featured characters in the series. In Heroes Reborn, she tragically meets her demise while giving birth to Malina and Tommy.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Claire's exceptional healing potential and pain tolerance set her apart, drawing comparisons to the X-Men character Wolverine, albeit without the hairy features and claws. Describing her ability to West, Claire notes that she indeed feels pain but quickly overcomes it. Following a brain examination by Sylar, Claire claims to no longer feel any physical pain. The intricacies of Claire's character, coupled with her superhuman capabilities, contribute to her central role and emotional journey within the Heroes storyline.

			<h2>Nikki Sanders</h2>
			<p>
				Nicole Sanders, portrayed by Ali Larter in the television series Heroes, is a complex fictional character with a central role in the show. Niki is the wife of D. L. Hawkins and the mother of Micah Sanders. Suffering from dissociative identity disorder, she exhibits superhuman strength, accessible only when her alter ego, "Jessica," takes control. Tim Kring, the creator of Heroes, initially envisioned Niki with the power to be in two places at once, rooted in her life as a single mother. Originally conceived as a showgirl, Niki's character evolved into an internet stripper due to Ali Larter not fitting the initial showgirl vision. The character underwent further transformations, ultimately being replaced by Tracy Strauss to provide Larter with a different role and to explore an origin story.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Niki's background adds depth to her character, revealing her as one of three identical triplets injected with Arthur Petrelli's formula as babies. Adopted by an abusive alcoholic father named Hal Sanders, Niki endured years of mistreatment along with her sister, Jessica. Jessica was strangled to death by Hal, leading Niki to develop an alternate persona. As an adult, Niki confronts her past, discovering the truth about her father's actions and the abuse she suffered. Overcoming her own struggles with alcoholism and gambling, Niki reunites with her father, demanding he never contact her again after a confrontation as Jessica. This intricate background contributes to Niki's complex narrative and emotional journey in Heroes.

			<h2>Micah Sanders</h2>
			<p>
				Micah Sanders is a major character in multiple seasons of the NBC drama Heroes as well as a recurring role in Heroes Reborn as a EVO activist. He's played by Noah Gray-Cabey. He is the son of Niki Sanders and D.L. Hawkins who discovers that he can communicate with computers and other electronic devices with technopathy.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				After his mother, Niki, performed a striptease to a webcam in the garage, she discovered Micah working on his computer. Micah has also recently built a pin-hole camera for the solar eclipse so he could watch the moon cover up the sun at school later on. After Micah informed his mother that he was ready for school, they left the house in a rush when Niki discovered two men at their door. Later on, while Micah was reading a 9th Wonders! comic, Niki visited her son's private school and is given bad news about Micah's late tuition from his principal. As Niki left, she saw her reflection moving differently than she was. Haunted by what she saw, she yelled at the image to leave her alone, much to the confusion of her son. To the disappointment of Micah, Niki took him to her friend's house while she talked to her about the situation. Later on, Micah left a voice message to Niki, begging that she pick him up straightaway.
