			<h2>Gabriel Gray (Sylar)</h2>
			<p>
				Gabriel Gray, also known as Sylar, is a fictional character and a primary antagonist in the NBC superhero drama series Heroes, portrayed by Zachary Quinto. As a super-powered serial killer, Sylar targets other individuals with superhuman abilities to steal their powers. Initially serving as the main villain in the first season, Sylar later becomes a recurring antagonist, with the writers exploring his attempts to become a hero and control his murderous instincts across seasons two, three, and four. The character undergoes moments of redemption and relapses, showcasing a complex and evolving persona. In the series' penultimate episode, Sylar experiences over three years of penitence in a mental prison and ultimately identifies himself as a hero in the show's finale, marked by its cancellation.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Sylar's concept originally involved him as a cannibal who consumed his victims' brains to absorb their powers. However, to avoid potential silliness and zombie associations, the producers deliberately kept this aspect vague in the series. The character's ambiguous relationship with consuming brains is addressed in the season three premiere when he acquires Claire Bennet's regenerative powers through examination of her brain. Sylar's personality and motivations stem from his upbringing as the son of a watchmaker, influenced by his mother's assertions that he is special and deserves more in life. Driven by an "evolutionary imperative" to acquire new abilities, he takes on the name <i>Sylar</i> from a watch brand, disconnecting from his former identity as Gabriel Gray. Despite his complex nature, Sylar became one of the iconic villains in television, earning a spot on TV Guide's list of <i>The 60 Nastiest Villains of All Time</i> in 2013.

			<h2>Noah Bennet</h2>
			<p>
				Noah Bennet was a major character and anti-hero from the NBC drama Heroes played by Jack Coleman. In the Heroes Reborn series he has become the hero.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				At first glance, Noah Bennet appears to be an ordinary businessman who works at the Primatech Paper Company and lives in Odessa, Texas, with his wife, Sandra, and two children, Claire and Lyle. However, he and his associates have actually traveled the world for a number of years investigating superhuman phenomena and tracking down and experimenting on people with these abilities. Bennet lives in a world of "morally gray" and is considered a Company Man, doing anything the company asks of him. However, his true allegiance is to his family.
